## Most Important Things to Know

### The 3 Core Apps (80% of deals)
1. **Zoho CRM** - Sales/lead management ($14-52/user/month)
2. **Zoho Books** - Accounting/invoicing ($15-120/org/month)
3. **Zoho Desk** - Customer support ($14-40/agent/month)

### The Sales Framework
```
1. Ask discovery questions (diagnose pain)
2. Calculate their current cost of problem
3. Show how Zoho solves it
4. Calculate ROI (savings/gains vs. investment)
5. Handle objections with prepared responses
6. Close with confidence
```

### The Magic Formula
```
Customer's Problem → Zoho Solution → ROI Calculation = Sale

Example:
"Leads lost in Excel" → "Zoho CRM" → "Convert 10% more leads = $X additional revenue vs. $Y investment = Z×ROI" = Deal Closed
```

## Emergency Cheat Sheet

### When Client Says... → You Say...

**"What is Zoho?"**
→ "Business software suite - CRM, accounting, support, projects, HR - all integrated. Think of it as running your entire business on one platform instead of 10 disconnected tools."

**"Too expensive"**
→ "Let's calculate: You're spending $X on [their current problem]. Zoho costs $Y. Net savings: $Z per month. Make sense?"

**"We use [competitor]"**
→ "Great! How's it working? [Listen for pain] Zoho is typically 40-60% cheaper with same/more features. Worth comparing side-by-side?"

**"Too complicated"**
→ "Fair concern. Actually simpler than [Salesforce/etc]. Most teams productive within a week. Can I show you a 10-minute demo?"

**"Need to think about it"**
→ "Absolutely. To help your thinking - is it budget, features, timing, or something else I can clarify?"

**"What's the ROI?"**
→ [Open relevant section, use their numbers, calculate] "Based on your numbers: $X problem cost, $Y solution cost, $Z net benefit. ROI: [N]x"
